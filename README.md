# Batea

Batea is the spanish word for a gold pan. 
Batea is a software solution for data mining browser histories, specifically for semantic data that might have clinical signifigance.
It is intended to work hand in hand with the [Wikiproject Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine)  in order to translate browsing patterns into long term improvements to Wikipedias medical articles.

Or at least thats the idea anyway.
